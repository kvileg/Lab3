Istanbul instrumenter library.

Version 1.\+1.\+x now implements instrumentation using {\ttfamily Babel}. The implementation is inspired by prior art by @dtinth as demonstrated in the {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+coverage\+\_\+\+\_\+} babel plugin.

It provides 2 "{}modes"{} of instrumentation.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The old API that is mostly unchanged (except for incompatibilities noted) and performs the instrumentation using babel as a library.
\item A {\ttfamily program\+Visitor} function for the Babel AST that can be used by a Babel plugin to emit instrumentation for ES6 code directly without any source map processing. This is the preferred path for babel users. The Babel plugin is called {\ttfamily babel-\/plugin-\/istanbul}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Incompatibilities and changes to instrumentation behavior can be found in v0-\/changes.md.
